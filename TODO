Bug Fixes:
  ✔ Scrollbar isn't showing up in correct container for feed @done(23-08-18 16:25)
    ✔ Goes over header @done(23-08-18 16:25)
    ✔ Becomes very large when fetching @done(23-08-18 16:25)
  ☐ Last comment card has `border-bottom` showing through parent container
  ✔ Icons should be sized using `rem` rather than `px` @done(23-08-18 16:57)
  ☐ Header bottom bar not reaching side to side -> Seems to be margin issue

Things to consider:
  ☐ Use Firebase client library to access HN API
  ☐ Write tests
  ✔ Delete `commentsSlice.ts` if not needed @done(23-08-18 19:35)
  ☐ See if we can improve rendering time
  ☐ See if we can improve fetching time
    ☐ Do we need to fetch 50 posts at once? Maybe reduce to 30?
    ☐ Do we need to fetch all comments at once?
      ☐ Should we rather fetch `x` amount of comments, as well as few children comments for each?
