Bug Fixes:
  ✔ Scrollbar isn't showing up in correct container for feed @done(23-08-18 16:25)
    ✔ Goes over header @done(23-08-18 16:25)
    ✔ Becomes very large when fetching @done(23-08-18 16:25)
  ✘ Last comment card has `border-bottom` showing through parent container @cancelled(23-08-21 19:18)
  ✔ Icons should be sized using `rem` rather than `px` @done(23-08-18 16:57)
  ✔ Spinner colour needs to be changed, so it works with background colours @done(23-08-22 00:58)
  ✔ Comment content still expanding too far out of container @done(23-08-21 22:40)
  ✔ Comment links sometimes not being shortened @done(23-08-21 22:40)
  ☐ Comment borders sometimes overlap and double up -> Not sure specifically when
  ☐ Width of feed not maximized as expected when full desktop (not in Inspect mode)

Things to consider:
  ✘ Use Firebase client library to access HN API @cancelled(23-08-23 17:33)
    Not worth to do so -> The HN API itself does not offer realtime, furthermore, cannot access all their data at once
      Requires us to fetch each post and comment individually still and store into own database 
      
  ☐ Write tests
  ✔ Delete `commentsSlice.ts` if not needed @done(23-08-18 19:35)
  ☐ See if we can improve rendering time
  ✔ See if we can improve fetching time @done(23-08-23 17:51)
    ✔ Do we need to fetch 50 posts at once? Maybe reduce to 25? @done(23-08-23 17:51)
    ✘ Do we need to fetch all comments at once? @cancelled(23-08-23 17:51)
      ✘ Should we rather fetch `x` amount of comments, as well as few children comments for each? @cancelled(23-08-23 17:51)
  ✔ Refactor CSS class names to not use camel case @done(23-08-21 15:58)
  ✔ Header not exactly 10vh @done(23-08-21 22:08)
    Temporarily solved by calc(10vh - 2px) for the 2px bottom border, likely should change to rem units
  ☐ Dark mode?
    ☐ Normalize colours into CSS variables?
  ☐ 404 page?
